* New in XMakemol 5.13

** Customizable bounding box.
Bounding box parameters can now be specified in input files using the
BBOX_XYZ keyword to give the minimum and maximum bounding box
coordinates.

** Allow system to be split into molecules.
The start of a new molecule is signified by the keyword MOLECULE on
any atom's input line. Bond and H-bond factors are now split into
independent intermolecular and intramolecular values.

** GL2PS updated to version 1.1.2.

** Increased maximum atom size; allows space-filling like rendering.

* New in XMakemol 5.10

** Render different groups of atoms with different rendering modes.

** GL2PS updated to version 1.0.0.
Allows export of OpenGL scenes to EPS and PDF formats.
