* XMakemol Problems

This file contains descriptions and solutions to known problems.

** Parsing XYZ files

If XMakemol has problems parsing XYZ files, then it may be because of
the setting of the LANG environment variable. Assuming you are using a
bash-like shell, try launching the program with:

    $ LANG=en_GB xmakemol

** Saving XPM files

With OpenGL rendering you might get unexpected results, like seeing
cutouts in your XPM image where any windows overlapped the main
drawing area.  A workaround for this problem, if you are using
XFree86, is to enable a backing store in your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4:

    Section "Device"

            [...]

            Option              "BackingStore"
    EndSection

If this is successful, then in your /var/log/XFree86.0.log file you
should see lines like:

    (**) TRIDENT(0): Option "BackingStore"
    (**) TRIDENT(0): Backing store enabled
